* liblinear-experiment
This repo is the project of mpml, aiming to solve a
two-class classification problem using liblinear in multi-kernal
machines.

The min-max network is used to decompose the task so that it can be
fully parallelized. I will campare the performance between randomized
partition and label-based partition.
* Todo
- [x] Using liblinear to solve the origin problem
- [x] Using min-max network to solve the same problem
- Parallelize the min-max network
- Partition data by labels
- Measure the time cost in different solution
- Compare the performance between different solution
- Enhance the IO of data files (json needs additional parser)
- Avoid reading data file for multiple times
